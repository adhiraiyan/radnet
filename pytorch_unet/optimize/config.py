"""Write the config tuning file here
This might be the same as the hyperparamter tuning or you can call hp tuning from here, then task will call config
config calls hp tuning and then hp tuning calls training, and you start logging values in a different logger

This can be like the task file for hp tuning, you will use config parser and have the configs saved in a different
config.ini file
